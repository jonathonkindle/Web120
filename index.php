    <h3>A little about me.</h3>
    <img src="images/tablet.jpg" class="tablet" alt="" />
    <p>My name is Jonathon Kindle. I was born in Las Vegas, NV on an air force base and moved to Washington when i was about 4 years old. My family moved around a couple of times throughout the years, but we stayed in King County the whole time. It wasn't until I turned 29 that I moved to Seattle and I must say I love it here.</p>
    <p>As of right now, I am a full time student pursuing a degree in programming. I am fairly new to it all but am definitly hooked. I started the program thinking that I want to be a game developer (and a part of me still wants to be), but the more I study the full stack development for web based applications, the more interested I become.</p>
    <p>I am really looking forward to learning all I can during my time at Seattle Central and applying it to a job that I will love!</p>
    <p>When I am not studying, My fiancee and I like to spen our time getting out as much as possible or simply hanging out at home playing video games together. I enjoy getting out on my fixed gear and cruising the city or the Burke Gillman trail. When I am lucky, and have the time, I like to get out to the mountains and hike (the I90 corridor is filled with beautiful places to go!). Aside from these hobbies, I spend my time tinkering with bicycles and computers and cars.</p>
