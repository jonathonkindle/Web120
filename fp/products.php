    <p>Wait a few days after any fresh snowfall and the entire area becomes one giant freeride trail after all the shredders pack down the powder. There are actually three trails which make up the loop: Horse Creek-Cattle Creek-Lower Twin Lake. Proper sized jumps, berms, rollers and wooden features, so sick! Only about 25% of the trail is good to ride. Better yet, don't do it unless other people are pretty confident in your fitness.</p>

    <p>There is no preferred direction and the trail is a great connector for several other fun loops. Out here you will find the most legal features including log rides, jumps and rock rolls in South Tahoe including the new jumps, berms, rollers and hips TAMBA and SBTS built in 2014. On the bike map it is often combined as the Whole Enchilada with Porcupine Rim, Kokopelli, Hazard County and Burro Pass. This trail is now a designated one way from the Lee's Train/C$ intersection. The turns are all smooth berms and easy to ride and not wash out.</p>

    <p>On the bike map it is often combined as the Whole Enchilada with Porcupine Rim, Kokopelli, Hazard County and Burro Pass. The main bike trail is about 18KM long with a gentle -5% grade. Lots of branches. The ending is real rutted out, so be careful not to lock up your tire and make it worse. It is considered the "fast and flowy" section--quite a bit smoother overall than Butcher Ranch with a great downhill pitch.</p>
