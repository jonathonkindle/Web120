    <p>There are a lot of elements that go into creating a web page. Among those is one very impactful element that is often overlooked by new developers and many small businesses. The image gallery is a powerhouse feature that brings life to any website.</p>

    <blockquote>“Visual design is often essential for the success of a web presence, and is equally important for both blogs and web stores.”<sup>1</sup></blockquote>

    <blockquote>“Galleries are a popular way of integrating images into a website, allowing users to see several images clearly at once.”<sup>1</sup></blockquote>

    <p>Using an image gallery to display your products or services allows for a more user friendly and enjoyable experience when visiting a website. Displaying high quality images in a way that is appealing to your sites visitors will help to ensure that you not only hold that customers business, but will also set your site apart from less thoughtfully designed websites, bringing in more viewers and potential customers.</p>

    <blockquote>“Customers want to see what they're buying. On retail sites, users expect to be able to view high resolution closeups of products to get a better look at details, and study participants got frustrated if they weren't able to.”<sup>2</sup></blockquote>

    <p>They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and when your pictures are presented in a way that draws your customers in, then you have just saved yourself and your customers time and money.</p>

    <blockquote>“Large blocks of text can often scare visitors off before they even read the content. Graphics and images are therefore hugely important elements of any website, whether they’re used to illustrate a text, to create a personal or emotional bond with the user, or to visualize the details of a product.”<sup>1</sup></blockquote>

    <p>If traffic to your site is what you are looking for, do yourself a favor and invest in a well designed image gallery! </p>

    <blockquote>“Adding an HTML photo gallery to your site will not only make your page more attractive but will also engage your visitors and increase the time they spend on page.”<sup>2</sup></blockquote>
