    <p>Website design and layout is critical when it comes to producing a new site, from the way it responds to different size screens, to the look and feel of the overall result. A great design lets the user know that you care about their experience and are willing to go that extra mile to provide top quality service. Floats have been the go to answer for responsive design (including navigation bars and column resizing and positioning), until Flexbox came along.</p>

    <blockquote>“For the last decade or so, floats were the sole option for laying out a complex web page. As a result, they’re well supported even in legacy browsers, and developers have used them to build millions of web pages."<sup>1</sup></blockquote>
    
    <p>Flexbox offers a more efficient, and more feature packed way to build a website. Whereas float primarily positioned elements to the left and right, flexbox allows for positioning up and down as well as much cleaner and more organized spacing between elements.</p>

    <blockquote>“The “Flexible Box” or “Flexbox” layout mode offers an alternative to Floats for defining the overall appearance of a web page. Whereas floats only let us horizontally position our boxes, flexbox gives us complete control over the alignment, direction, order, and size of our boxes.”<sup>1</sup></blockquote>

    <blockquote>“If "regular" layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, the flex layout is based on "flex-flow directions".”<sup>2</sup></blockquote>
