    <blockquote>“By 2019, there will be 8.2 billion handheld or personal mobile-ready devices, and the global mobile data traffic will increase nearly tenfold between 2014 and 2019.”<sup>2</sup></blockquote>

    <p>Mobile friendly design has to be the main focus for companies looking to get there services and products out to the general population. Responsive websites and mobile apps both achieve this same end result, however, the structure of each is very different and includes many considerations before deciding on one over the other.</p>

    <blockquote>“Mobile apps can be powerful for brand awareness, marketing, and creating a quality user experience”, however, “when done poorly, the great brand awareness present in native apps can work against businesses: If consumers see a shoddy app, it makes the business seem amateur.”<sup>1</sup></blockquote>
    
    <p>Mobile apps are typically built to each operating systems requirements, which means that developing an app is going to take more time and will ultimately cost more money. The benefit however is that users get a very seamless and satisfying experience (if built properly) that is fast and easy to use and gives your company great brand recognition. All of this depends greatly on the design of the app though.</p>

    <blockquote>“The average shelf-life of an app is pretty short, less than 30 days according to some research, so unless your app is something truly unique and/or useful (ideally, both), it’s questionable how long it will last on a user’s device. Mobile websites on the other hand are always available for users to return to them.”<sup>3</sup></blockquote>

    <p>Time and money are important factors to consider in deciding how best to reach your audience. Most companies will need or already have a website for users to visit, which means there is already a platform in place to build in responsive mobile websites as a part of the main site. This is usually a much less expensive and and more time efficient option. As with any decision though, there will always be pros and cons to consider. Starting with a responsive website, and then building a mobile app is the direction I would choose to go.</p>
