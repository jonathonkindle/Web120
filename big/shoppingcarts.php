    Visit any website that offers goods and/or services and you will eventually come across a shopping cart. The shopping cart is the backbone of online shopping and transactions.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    “A shopping cart on an online retailer's site is a piece of software that facilitates the purchase of a product or service. It accepts the customer's payment and organizes the distribution of that information to the merchant, payment processor and other parties.”<sup>1</sup>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
    This software facilitates the flow of information between the customer, the retailer, and the bank. It holds the items that you desire, calculates the shipping and tax info, collects your payment information, and gives you an overview of the purchase you have just made.
    </p>

    <p>
    As an online retailer, a shopping cart is a no brainer, however, you do need to decide whether you will use a hosted shopping cart from a third-party host, or use your own licensed shopping cart.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    “Hosted solutions are often recommended for those who are beginning their own venture because they require less technical expertise. That's not to say all new online retail store owners aren't adept in IT, but a hosted solution may free up time to focus on other aspects of operations.”<sup>1</sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Shopping carts can easily become very extensive and feature rich depending on your needs though. Research what is available and determine exactly what your business needs before rushing into a decision and you will be rewarded with a much smoother experience. If you decide to go with a hosted service, take into consideration that there are 3 main types of software.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    1.  Ordering System Software (ie: PayPal, LinkPoint, BluePay…)
    With order system software, you develop an “order” button for each product that is displayed. When your customer clicks on it, they are led to an order system where the transaction is completed.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
    2.  Store-Building Software (ie: Magento, Miva Merchant….)
    This software system handles the products, their prices, taxation, shipping calculations, etc. With numerous price discounts and promotions being introduced, this system allows you to maintain and manage a database from a single web interface.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
    3.  Specialized Systems
    This is a specialized system that is unique and customized. There are two different types of specialized systems:
    B2B Sales: With customers who are businesses itself, you need some additional features. This software provides you with just that. You can manage customer accounts and individual pricing schemes.
    Membership Sites: The second type is membership kinds that offer subscription sites. Paying for a specific period, your customers can have access to games, photographs, etc. <sup>2</sup>
